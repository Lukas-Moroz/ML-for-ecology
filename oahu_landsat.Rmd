```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# load packages 

library(terra)
library(tidyverse)
library(here) # I use this to easily create relative file paths

# set file path to data folder 

oahu_raw_data <- here("low_resolution/oahu")


```

Read in one raster and convert to data frame (as an example)

```{r}

first_rast <- terra::rast(file.path(oahu_raw_data,"Oahu_2014_LS8_composite_low_resolution.tif")) #read in the tif file as a SpatRaster using terra

first_rast # get summary of whats in the raster

nlyr(first_rast) # there are the bands

# what happens when we run as data frame


first_df <- as.data.frame(first_rast, xy = T)


```

Loop to read in each raster and convert to data frame. The steps will:
- run through each file and read it in as a Spat Raster
- create a df of each
- save each one in a list with a new column for year

```{r}

# list each landsat raster

tif_files <- list.files(oahu_raw_data,
                        pattern = ".tif")

# create empty list

df_list <- list()

for (i in 1:length(tif_files)){
  
  # for testing
 # i = 1
  
  # file name
  f = tif_files[i]
  
  # get year from file name
  year = substr(f,6,9)
  
  # read in raster
  rast = terra::rast(file.path(oahu_raw_data,f))
  
  # convert to df, add column with year
  
  df <- as.data.frame(rast, xy = T) %>% mutate(image_year = rep(year, nrow(.)))
  
  # save to list 

  df_list[[i]] <- df
  
}


# now we have a list of dfs for each year 

```
